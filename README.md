=========================================

[MIaS][] (Math Indexer and Searcher) is a math-aware full-text search engine.
It is based on [Apache Lucene][lucene]; however, its maths processing
capabilities are standalone and can be easily integrated into any
[Lucene/Solr][solr] based system, as in [EuDML][] search service.

Usage
=====
Setting up `mias.properties`
----------------------------
Create a file named `mias.properties` in some location, e.g.
`/home/MIaS/conf/mias.properties`, and set up the following properties:

  - `INDEXDIR` – Path to the directory, where the index is / will be located.
  - `UPDATE` – If `TRUE`, the files that are already indexed and are about to
    be indexed again, will be updated. If `FALSE`, the indexer will skip them
    and only add new files.
  - `MAXRESULTS` – The maximum number of results that the system retrieves.
  - `DOCLIMIT` - The limit for the number of the documents that are indexed
    during one run. `-1` means no limit.
  - `THREADS` - The number of threads that will be used for processing.

The resulting file might have the following content:

```
INDEXDIR=/home/data/index
UPDATE=false
MAXRESULTS=10000
DOCLIMIT=-1
THREADS=8
```

In Windows, backslashes in paths need to be escaped, e.g. you would insert
`C:\\MIaS\\index` instead of `C:\MIaS\index`.

Running MIaS
------------
To run MIaS, locate the JAR file of MIaS and run the following command:

```
java -jar MIaS.jar [OPTIONS]
```

To see the available options, run the following command:

```
java -jar MIaS.jar -help
```

There must exist a directory named `lib` containing necessary dependencies
located within the same directory as the jar file.

               a system for mathematics retrieval is presented, and design
               decisions are discussed. We argue for an approach based on
               Presentation MathML using a similarity of math subformulae. The
               system was implemented as a math-aware search engine based on
               the state-of-the-art system Apache Lucene. Scalability issues
               were checked against more than 400,000 arXiv documents with 158
               million mathematical formulae. Almost three billion MathML
               subformulae were indexed using a Solr-compatible Lucene.},
